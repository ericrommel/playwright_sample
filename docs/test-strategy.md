# Test Strategy Document

## Project Overview

The project involves writing automated tests for the demo application available at <https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers>.
The primary focus is on testing the functionality of adding a new computer to the database. The tests will be written using
Cypress and JavaScript, with preference given to TypeScript. The exercise is expected to be completed within a duration of 3 to 5 hours.

## Objectives

- To ensure the reliability and correctness of the "Add a new computer" functionality.
- To cover basic and edge cases to validate the robustness of the application.
- To deliver a comprehensive automation solution meeting the specified technical criteria.

## Test Scope

The test scope includes automated testing of the "Add a new computer" functionality. The tests should encompass both
positive and negative scenarios, covering various input combinations, alert messages, error conditions and database persistence checks.

## Testing Approach

1. **Scenario Identification:** Identify at least two scenarios for automation based on the functionality requirements.
2. **Test Case Design:** Design test cases to cover basic and edge cases for each scenario, including alert message verification and database persistence checks.
3. **Test Script Development:** Develop test scripts using Cypress and JavaScript, with a preference for TypeScript.
4. **Execution and Validation:** Execute the tests and validate the functionality against expected outcomes.
5. **Reporting and Documentation:** Document test results, findings, and any issues encountered during the testing process.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Environment Stability:** Ensure the stability of the testing environment to prevent any disruptions during test execution.
- **Application Changes:** Monitor for any changes to the application that may impact test script functionality and update the scripts accordingly.

## Deliverables

- Automated test scripts written in Cypress.
- A GitHub repository containing the solution.
- Descriptive commit messages providing a clear history of work.
- README file with instructions on running the tests.
- **Optional:** Summary of findings and any encountered issues with resolutions.
- **Optional:** Explanation of the approach and decision-making process.
