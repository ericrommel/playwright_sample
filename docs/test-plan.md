# Test Plan Document

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1

Add a new computer successfully:

- Verify that a new computer can be added with valid input data.
- Validate that the alert message confirming the addition is displayed.
- Check if the computer is saved in the database.

### Scenario 2

Error handling for adding a new computer

- Test adding a computer with invalid or missing input data (e.g., empty fields, invalid dates).
- Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed and functionality is not affected.

## Test Cases

### Scenario 1: Add a new computer successfully

1. Enter valid computer details (computer name, introduced date, discontinued date, company).
2. Click on the "Create this computer" button.
3. Verify that the computer is successfully added to the database.

### Scenario 2: Error handling for adding a new computer

1. Leave one or more required fields empty and attempt to add a computer.
2. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for each missing field.
3. Enter invalid data (e.g., invalid date format) and attempt to add a computer.
4. Validate that the system handles the error gracefully and provides informative feedback.

## Test Execution

- **Tools:** Cypress with JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Environment:** The demo application available at <https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers>.
